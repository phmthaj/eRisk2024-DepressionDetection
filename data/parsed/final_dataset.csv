6,528281_0_0,0,my now ex girlfriend Alex she has pretty bad anxiety problems that although she told me about i never fully comprehended or took into consideration until now she will begin taking medication for it in the up coming weeks we lived a 15minute drive away from eachother yet a 45min bus ride away bc she lives in brookyln and i live in staten island (for any who know the New York area) making it sometimes hard to see eachother but we managed to do it every weekend my question is should i take her back of course its about what im feeling and if i can truly forgive her but anyway * Alex and i began dating a year ago and our anniversary would have been this Sunday April 10th for almost the entire month of march we argued every other day over little things and big things most notably her refusal to delete another guys number from her phone she had recently met the week before at a sweet 16 his name Rob he was a dancer at the sweet 16 * she met him with a group of her friends and her friend sydney hooked up with one of Rob's dancing coworkers and they all decided to hangout a few days later which i had no problem with the problem occurred when Rob gave Alex his number through instagram and they began texting reguraly throughout the day similar to how me and Alex would.

The 4 of us finished our fifths and we spent the rest of the night drinking whatever was handed to us.. I don't even remember midnight but I do remember not knowing where one of my friends was, so I went downstairs to find him and he was passed out on a bean bag, since I found this hilarious I took a quick picture of him.. When I looked at the picture I just took I noticed his face was covered in blood.. So we got a couple sober friends to drive him to the hospital where he ended up having to get something like 12 stitches in his forehead and resuscitated 3 times.. After my buddy left I don't remember anything and woke up on the floor in my own bedroom.. I learned later that day that I was being a drunk asshole and wouldn't let my other friend drive me home because I didn't want to leave my car, and since he couldn't drive a stick I worked the gas/brake/clutch and shifter while he steered.. Once we got home I drank more with my family and ended up puking a couple of times..  Also I was on my floor because my friend says when he tried to move me to my bed I told him everytime he touched me he ""rocked the boat"" definitely not the most responsible night of my life... But at least I have the story... Also, my friend who went to the hospital ended up being okay, he was laughing about it the next day and kinda became a legend at school... Senior year was fun TL;DR Drank too much, friend died a couple of times, and we tag-team drunk drove our irresponsible asses home"

Doe' the she told me 'wait... JOHN S. DOE??"
